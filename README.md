# Sentry Data

The Sentry App queries the NASA Sentry API for data about potential asteroid impacts with earth in the next 100+ years and gives detailed information about each "virtual impactor," including calculated date of impact, velocity upon reaching Earth's atmosphere, impact probability, and more. 

Also, using the Wikipedia API, the site provides a brief descpription of the Sentry Program as well as a link to further reading.
